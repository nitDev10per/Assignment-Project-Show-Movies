Properties like pathData, strokeWidth, strokeColor control the lines.\\n\\n- Together these create a green background with a subtle grid pattern overlay, to be used as the default launcher icon background. \\n\\n- The vector format and multiple path elements allow this pattern to scale seamlessly to different icon sizes without losing quality.\\n\\n- This file is located in the res/drawable folder, making it available as a drawable resource that can be referenced from XML layouts or code.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a scalable vector drawable to use as the default launcher icon background graphic for the app.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML file defines an adaptive icon for the launcher icon in Android apps.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines an adaptive icon resource that can adapt to different screen densities and formats.\\n\\n- \\u003cbackground\\u003e element specifies the background drawable for the icon. This will be shown as a silhouette on some devices.\\n\\n- \\u003cforeground\\u003e element specifies the main icon image that will be composited over the background. \\n\\n- \\u003cmonochrome\\u003e element specifies an alternative monochrome version of the icon that can be shown on devices that only support monochrome icons, like Android Auto. \\n\\n- Allows the icon to adapt its shape and appearance depending on device/OS settings to follow material design icon guidelines for different contexts like launcher, notifications, etc. \\n\\n- Provides a single icon definition that can generate appropriately sized and formatted icon images for different densities and usages across Android versions in a resolution-independent way.\\n\\nSo in summary, this file defines a single adaptive icon resource that can generate launcher icons that adapt to different devices and formats following material design standards.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher_round.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML file defines an adaptive icon for the app launcher icon.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It is located in the mipmap-anydpi-v26 folder, which indicates it is for providing an adaptive icon on Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher.\\n\\n- \\u003cadaptive-icon\\u003e is the root element for defining an adaptive icon.\\n\\n- \\u003cbackground\\u003e specifies the background drawable for the icon, which will be shown on the launcher.\\n\\n- \\u003cforeground\\u003e specifies the foreground drawable that will be composited over the background. This provides the icon image. \\n\\n- \\u003cmonochrome\\u003e specifies an optional monochrome version of the foreground that can be shown on devices that only support monochrome icons.\\n\\n- Together, the background, foreground, and optional monochrome drawables define the adaptive icon that can adapt for different contexts like launcher, notifications, etc. on Android 8.0 and higher devices.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the layered drawables that compose the app\\u0027s adaptive launcher icon for newer Android versions with adaptive icon support.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/java/com/example/letestmovies/MainActivity2.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a MainActivity2 class that extends AppCompatActivity. It is used to display details about a movie that were passed from another activity via an Intent.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- onCreate(): Called when the activity is created. Finds views by ID and sets up click listeners.\\n\\n- getIntent(): Gets the Intent that started this activity and extracts extra data like movie title, overview, poster etc. \\n\\n- setText(): Sets the text of TextView widgets like title, overview, ratings to display movie details.\\n\\n- load(): Loads and displays the movie poster image using Glide image loading library. \\n\\nSo in summary, this activity displays more detailed movie information that was passed from another activity via an Intent. It retrieves the data from the Intent and populates TextViews and ImageView to show the movie details on the screen.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/test/java/com/example/letestmovies/ExampleUnitTest.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains unit tests for the com.example.letestmovies package.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is located in src/test/java, which indicates it contains test code rather than production code.\\n\\n- It imports the JUnit testing framework (org.junit.Test).\\n\\n- It has a test method annotated with @Test, which is the basic unit of a JUnit test.\\n\\n- The test method contains an assertion (assertEquals) to verify the expected behavior. In this case testing that 2 + 2 equals 4. \\n\\n- No setup or teardown methods are included, keeping it a simple example test.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It contains JUnit tests for the package\\n- Has a test method annotated with @Test \\n- Includes an assertion to validate expected behavior\\n- Located properly in src/test to distinguish from production code\\n\\nThe key function is to provide a simple example unit test to validate basic logic, demonstrating how to write and structure unit tests with JUnit.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This AndroidManifest.xml file defines the core configuration and components of an Android application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Declares the necessary permissions the app requires, in this case internet access.\\n\\n- Defines the application attributes like name, icon, theme etc. \\n\\n- Registers the app\\u0027s activities (screens/views) - here MainActivity is set as the launcher and entry point. MainActivity2 is not exported/public.\\n\\n- Sets the intent filters to identify MainActivity as the app launcher. \\n\\n- Configures backup/restore rules for app data.\\n\\n- Provides metadata for build tools like target SDK version.\\n\\nIn summary, the manifest file provides the essential configuration to tell the Android system how to install and run the app. It registers app components and declares required permissions. This allows the app to integrate properly with the Android framework.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a vector drawable that is used as the launcher icon for the Android app.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It defines a vector drawable using the \\u003cvector\\u003e element. Vectors allow resolution-independent graphics.\\n\\n- It contains two \\u003cpath\\u003e elements that define the shapes of the icon. One for the main logo shape and one for the inner details. \\n\\n- Attributes like android:pathData, android:fillColor, android:strokeWidth etc are used to style the paths.\\n\\n- Gradients are defined inside \\u003cgradient\\u003e for color transitions in the main logo path.\\n\\n- Viewport size is set using android:viewportWidth and android:viewportHeight so it scales properly at different resolutions. \\n\\n- Width and height are set using android:width and android:height so it knows its intrinsic size.\\n\\n- This vector drawable is used as the launcher icon for the app, displayed on the home screen and in the app drawer.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the vector shape and styling for the launcher icon graphic in a resolution-independent way using Android vector drawables.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/poster.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML layout file defines the UI for a single poster item.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines a ConstraintLayout as the outermost container with layout parameters to control margins, padding etc. \\n\\n- Contains a CardView to style the poster item with elevation and padding \\n\\n- The CardView contains another ConstraintLayout to lay out the poster contents\\n\\n- ImageView defined to display the poster image at the top \\n\\n- TextView defined below the image to display the poster title/text \\n\\n- Constraints are defined to position the image and text views within the CardView width and relative to each other\\n\\n- Id attributes are defined that can be referenced from code to find and interact with the views\\n\\nSo in summary, this layout file defines the UI for a single poster item that can be displayed, including an image, title text and styling it as a card. The views and constraints allow it to be populated from data and interacted with from code.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This colors.xml file is used to define color resources in Android.\\n\\nSome key points about it:\\n\\n- It is located in the res/values folder, which is where XML resource files that don\\u0027t vary by configuration go.\\n\\n- The \\u003cresources\\u003e element acts as a container for all the color resources.\\n\\n- Each \\u003ccolor\\u003e element defines a color resource, identified by its name attribute. \\n\\n- The text content of each \\u003ccolor\\u003e element specifies the color value in hexadecimal format.\\n\\n- This allows colors to be defined once and reused throughout the app by referencing @color/name.\\n\\n- It centralizes color definitions so they can be easily changed in one place if needed.\\n\\n- The colors defined here can then be used as the color attribute in views in layout XML files.\\n\\n- Or in Java code by calling Resources.getColor(R.color.name)\\n\\n- It provides a consistent color palette for the entire app to follow.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines reusable color resources that can be accessed anywhere in the app code or layouts to maintain a consistent color scheme.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/java/com/example/letestmovies/click1.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a click1 interface.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the package com.example.letestmovies\\n\\n- click1 is an interface, denoted by the interface keyword\\n\\n- It defines a single method called onclick that takes a parameter of type list and returns nothing (void)\\n\\n- By defining an interface, it allows other classes to implement this interface and define their own onclick method signature that matches what is defined here.\\n\\n- Any class that implements this interface must provide an implementation of the onclick method.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a click1 interface \\n- The interface defines a single method onclick(list l)\\n- Other classes can implement this interface and provide their own onclick method\\n- This allows for a common callback method signature for any click/tap events across classes\\n\\nThe main purpose is to provide a common callback method signature that other classes can implement to handle click/tap events in a standardized way through this interface. It\\u0027s a way to define a contract for click handling that multiple classes can follow.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML file defines data extraction rules for Android backup and restore.\\n\\nThe key functions of this file include:\\n\\n- Controlling what data is backed up to the cloud via \\u003ccloud-backup\\u003e tags\\n\\n- Using \\u003cinclude\\u003e tags to specify data that should be backed up/transferred \\n\\n- Using \\u003cexclude\\u003e tags to specify data that should NOT be backed up/transferred\\n\\n- Separate sections for cloud backup (\\u003ccloud-backup\\u003e) and device transfers (\\u003cdevice-transfer\\u003e)\\n\\n- Cloud backup section currently just has a TODO comment, would need to add real \\u003cinclude\\u003e and \\u003cexclude\\u003e rules \\n\\n- Device transfer section is currently commented out, but could also define inclusion/exclusion rules for transferring data between devices\\n\\nSo in summary, this file allows the app developer to programmatically control which app data and files should and should not be included in Android backups, cloud syncs, and transfers between devices. It provides fine-grained control over what data is preserved or excluded during backup/restore operations.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/java/com/example/letestmovies/list.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a Java class called list that represents a movie item in a list/recycler view.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a constructor that takes in strings for the title, poster, info, release date, rating and overview to initialize the object.\\n\\n- It has getter methods for each property - getTitle(), getPoster() etc to retrieve the values. \\n\\n- The properties - title, poster, info etc are private strings that store the data for each movie item.\\n\\n- This class is likely used to store movie data retrieved from an API/database and populate a list/recycler view with custom movie items. Each item will be an instance of this list class.\\n\\n- The getter methods allow accessing the property values to display them in the list item views for things like title, poster image etc.\\n\\nSo in summary, it is a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class to represent a movie item with properties and getters to store and retrieve data to display in a list/recycler view for a movie app.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main2.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML layout file defines the user interface for an Android activity called MainActivity2.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It uses a ConstraintLayout as the root layout to allow flexible positioning of child views.\\n\\n- It contains a ScrollView to make the content scrollable, since there is more text than can fit on the screen. \\n\\n- Inside the ScrollView is a vertical LinearLayout to stack views vertically.\\n\\n- It contains several TextView widgets to display text like the title, release date, language etc. \\n\\n- It contains an ImageView to display a product image.\\n\\n- Attributes like id, width, height etc are defined to control each view\\u0027s appearance and position. \\n\\n- Tools attributes are used for previewing in the layout editor.\\n\\n- Font styles, text sizes are set to control text appearance. \\n\\n- autoSizeTextType is used to make text resize automatically to fit different screens.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the UI layout and styling for an activity screen to display product details with scrolling text and an image.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This file is called strings.xml and it is located in the res/values folder of an Android app project.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It contains string resources that can be referenced throughout the app code. This avoids hardcoding strings.\\n\\n- The \\u003cstring\\u003e elements define the strings, with a unique \\\&quot;name\\\&quot; attribute to identify each one. \\n\\n- In this example, there is a single string defined called \\\&quot;app_name\\\&quot; with the value \\\&quot;Letest Movies\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- This string can then be referenced in Java code using R.string.app_name or in XML layouts using @string/app_name.\\n\\n- Additional strings can be added for other text that needs to be localized, like labels, buttons, titles etc.\\n\\n- Localized versions of strings.xml can be provided in res/values-xx folders for other languages.\\n\\n- It allows strings to be easily updated in one place, and facilitates localization to other languages.\\n\\n- Avoid hardcoding strings in code for better maintenance and localization support.\\n\\nSo in summary, strings.xml is used to externalize all text outside of code for localization, avoid hardcoding, and provide a single source of strings.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/java/com/example/letestmovies/RecycleAdapter.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a RecyclerView adapter class called RecycleAdapter.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- onCreateViewHolder(): Inflates the item view layout and returns a ViewHolder instance.\\n\\n- onBindViewHolder(): Binds the data to views in the item layout. Loads image using Glide, sets title text, sets click listener on cardview. \\n\\n- getItemCount(): Returns the size of the data list to determine number of items to display.\\n\\n- ViewHolder: Inner class that represents each item view. Holds references to views in item layout.\\n\\nThis adapter is used to display a list of movie data in a RecyclerView. It takes in the context, data list and click listener. It inflates the item layout, loads images, sets text and click handlers to display the data in the RecyclerView.\\n\\nThe key responsibilities are:\\n\\n1. Inflate and return item views \\n2. Bind data to views\\n3. Handle click events\\n4. Provide number of items\\n\\nSo in summary, it connects the data to the RecyclerView to display a list using the item views.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/java/com/example/letestmovies/MainActivity.java\&quot;:\&quot;This MainActivity.java file is the main activity for an Android app that displays a list of movies fetched from an API.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- FetchDataTask - An AsyncTask that makes the network request to fetch movie data from the API in a background thread. Parses the JSON response and returns a list of movie objects.\\n\\n- initiateNetworkRequest() - Starts the FetchDataTask to initiate the network request.\\n\\n- onCreate() - Sets up the UI by finding views and setting click listeners. Starts the network request on a button click. \\n\\n- onclick() - Interface method that handles item clicks in the recyclerview. Starts a new activity to display movie details.\\n\\n- doInBackground() - Makes the HTTP request using OkHttp and parses the JSON response on a background thread. \\n\\n- onPostExecute() - Called after doInBackground finishes. Updates the UI by setting the adapter on the recyclerview.\\n\\n- Implements click1 interface to handle item clicks from the adapter. Starts a new activity to display movie details for the clicked item.\\n\\nSo in summary, it fetches movie data from an API asynchronously, displays it in a recyclerview, and handles item clicks to show movie details.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values-night/themes.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a night mode theme for the Android app.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It is located in the res/values-night folder, which indicates it contains theme definitions for night/dark mode.\\n\\n- The \\u003cresources\\u003e tag defines this as an XML resources file. \\n\\n- It defines a style called \\\&quot;Base.Theme.LetestMovies\\\&quot; which will be used as the base theme for the app.\\n\\n- The parent theme is set to \\\&quot;Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar\\\&quot; which is the default Material 3 theme that supports light/dark mode switching.\\n\\n- By inheriting from the Material 3 theme, it automatically gets all the default Material styling and behaviors for dark mode.\\n\\n- Customizations to the dark theme can be made by overriding style attributes here, such as changing the primary color.\\n\\n- When the device is in night/dark mode, this theme will be applied instead of the default light theme, allowing the app to also switch to a dark color scheme.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the base dark theme that will be used when the device/app is in night/dark mode, inheriting Material styling and allowing customizations for a consistent dark appearance.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/xml/backup_rules.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This backup_rules.xml file controls what data from the app is backed up during automatic device backups.\\n\\nThe key functions of this file are:\\n\\n- It allows including or excluding specific types of app data from backups. The main types are shared preferences, files, and databases.\\n\\n- The \\u003cfull-backup-content\\u003e element is the root element that contains include and exclude rules. \\n\\n- \\u003cinclude\\u003e elements specify what data should be backed up. The domain attribute indicates the type (sharedpref, files, etc) and the path specifies the location.\\n\\n- \\u003cexclude\\u003e elements specify what data should be excluded from backups. Same domain and path attributes.\\n\\n- By default everything is included. This file allows selectively configuring what specific parts of app data (preferences, files, databases) get backed up to the user\\u0027s Google/Android account for restoration on a new device.\\n\\n- It provides control and security by allowing the developer to prevent sensitive data from being backed up unintentionally.\\n\\nSo in summary, this backup_rules.xml file configures which app data gets automatically backed up during device backups to the user\\u0027s cloud account.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML layout file defines the user interface for the MainActivity in the app.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a ConstraintLayout as the root layout container\\n- Contains a vertical LinearLayout \\n- The LinearLayout contains:\\n  - An AutoCompleteTextView for search input\\n  - A ConstraintLayout\\n    - Contains a RecyclerView for listing items\\n    - Contains a Button\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the overall layout structure and containers \\n- Sets widths, heights and orientations of the layouts\\n- IDs views like the AutoCompleteTextView, RecyclerView and Button for referencing in code\\n- Sets basic properties like drawables, text etc on views\\n- Allows positioning of views using ConstraintLayout and tools attributes for design preview\\n- Provides the UI structure that the MainActivity will populate and interact with\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the visual structure and hierarchy of the main activity\\u0027s UI using different view groups and widgets.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This themes.xml file defines the themes used in the Android application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the base theme \\\&quot;Base.Theme.LetestMovies\\\&quot; which inherits from the Material3 DayNight theme with no action bar. This will be the parent theme for other themes.\\n\\n- Allows customizing the base theme by overriding attributes like colorPrimary.\\n\\n- Defines the main \\\&quot;Theme.LetestMovies\\\&quot; theme which inherits from the base theme. This will be the default theme used by activities if no other theme is specified. \\n\\n- Located in res/values/themes.xml so the themes are available as resources that can be referenced in the manifest or in code.\\n\\n- Uses the Material3 theme components which provide Material Design styling and behaviors out of the box.\\n\\n- Allows easy creation of additional themes by defining new styles that inherit from the base theme and override specific attributes.\\n\\n- Provides a standard light and dark theme that can be applied automatically based on the user\\u0027s device settings through use of the DayNight theme parent.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the core themes and styling for the app that activities and other components will use.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/letestmovies/ExampleInstrumentedTest.java\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains an instrumented test for the app.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- It is annotated with @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class) to indicate it should run with the AndroidJUnit4 test runner.\\n\\n- It contains a single test method called useAppContext().\\n\\n- This test method gets the Context of the app under test using InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation().getTargetContext().\\n\\n- It asserts that the package name of the app context is equal to the expected package name \\\&quot;com.example.letestmovies\\\&quot;. \\n\\n- This validates that the test is running against the correct app package.\\n\\n- It allows testing functionality that requires a Context without launching the app itself.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It is an instrumented test that runs on an Android device/emulator\\n- Gets the app Context for testing \\n- Validates the app package name\\n- Provides a basic smoke test that instrumentation is working correctly\&quot;}&quot;}" />
